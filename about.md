## ***Why Code?***

Some time ago, I graduated from a CS program dreading a life spent in software development.

I didn't know how to create, who for, how to share, why I should care.

I felt adrift between process and end-user. I chose other paths like teaching and business school. *Meanwhile the web continued to evolve.* It grew faster and faster, leapt to other screens, *served more and more people*.


## ***To Create and Contribute.***

This potential to serve cemented in my mind after experiencing a life-changing course.

The course, naturally, was on Web Development. Fittingly the classroom was [completely online.](https://www.udacity.com).

I saw clearly then how the web could topple barriers. It...

- Delivers limitless resources.

- Facilitates collaboration.

- Eases the friction in distribution.

Like puzzle pieces falling into place, *I found myself charting a path.*


## ***As a web engineer.***

I am the type who compulsively [wappalyzes](https://wappalyzer.com/) web pages. I'll spend hours for a moment of code clarity, trade days to save precious seconds of User load time.

I'm comfortable in a multitude of environments. I work well by myself but I thrive alongside good people. Whether for a client, with a parter or in a team my goal remains to do great work in service of Something Useful.

Like a record of my developer journey, here are some of the things I have been building on [GitHub]({{site.github.main}}).

A copy of my resume is [right here]({{site.resume}}).

You can also find me on [LinkedIn]({{site.linkedin}}).


## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Inspired by the development experiences shared by [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/) and [on the blog](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) of Joshua Lande.
