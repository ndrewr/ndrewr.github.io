## built on Jekyll + Hyde theme

Andrew R Chen's portfolio page circa 2015, aka Fun with Jekyll era.

WIP on new page!


## Having fun with Jekyll and Hyde
Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
