ClassTracks empowers language teachers with time-saving vocabulary practice and lesson assessment tools.

Teachers create units of vocab then link and assign to all students in a course through the app interface.

Students use the practice mode of the app, set up like a card game with language audio functionality. Progress is saved, giving the teacher insight into where to allocate classroom instruction time.

Contributions include implementing new features and UI/UX enhancements across the app.
