## ***As a JavaScript-focused, front-end web engineer and a person...***

I am committed to learning and personal growth.

I am the type who compulsively [wappalyzes](https://wappalyzer.com/) web pages. 

I'll spend hours for a moment of code clarity, trade days for precious seconds of User load time.

I am versatile, flexible. Comfortable in a multitude of environments, I work well by myself but I thrive alongside good people. 
Whether for a client, with a parter or in a team my goal remains to do great work in service of worthy goals.

Like a record of my developer journey, here are some of the things I have been building on [GitHub]({{site.github.main}}).

A copy of my resume is [right here]({{site.resume}}).

You can also find me on [LinkedIn]({{site.linkedin}}).

Oh and I also just took the [VIA Character
Survey](https://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths-Survey).
