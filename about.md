## ***As a web engineer.***

I love to learn and grow.

I am the type who compulsively [wappalyzes](https://wappalyzer.com/) web pages. I'll spend hours for a moment of code clarity, trade days to save precious seconds of User load time.

I'm comfortable in a multitude of environments. I work well by myself but I thrive alongside good people. Whether for a client, with a parter or in a team my goal remains to do great work in service of Something Useful.

Like a record of my developer journey, here are some of the things I have been building on [GitHub]({{site.github.main}}).

A copy of my resume is [right here]({{site.resume}}).

You can also find me on [LinkedIn]({{site.linkedin}}).
